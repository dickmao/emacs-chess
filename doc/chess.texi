@cindex position

A chess @dfn{position} is a given layout of pieces on a chess board,
also reflecting which side is next to move, and what privileges are
currently available to each side (castling short or long, en passant
capture, etc).

A position may be represented in @acronym{ASCII} using @acronym{FEN} (or EPD), or
graphically by displaying a chess board.  It is rather inconvenient to
render them verbally.

The position can be represented on a remote terminal using X windows, or
by transmitting the @acronym{FEN} string via a network connection, or clipboard,
to another chess board rendering tool.  It may of course also be
represented physically, by setting up the pieces to match the @acronym{FEN}
specification.

Chess puzzles are most often provided as a set of positions.

@node Creating positions, Position coordinates, Positions, Positions
@subsection Creating positions

@defun chess-pos-create &optional blank
Create a new chess position, set at the starting position.
If @var{blank} is non-nil, all of the squares will be empty.
The current side-to-move is always white.
@end defun

@defun chess-pos-copy position
Copy the given chess @var{position}.
If there are annotations or @acronym{EPD} opcodes set, these lists are copied as
well, so that the two positions do not share the same lists.
@end defun

@defvar chess-starting-position
Starting position of a chess game.
@end defvar

@defun chess-fischer-random-position 
Generate a Fischer Random style position.
@end defun

@node Position coordinates, Position details, Creating positions, Positions
@subsection Position coordinates
@cindex cooridnates

First of all, a coordinate system of octal indices is
used, where ?\044 signifies rank 4 file 4 (i.e., "e4").  Rank is
numbered 0 to 7, top to bottom, and file is 0 to 7, left to right.

@defun chess-index-rank index
Return the rank component of the given @var{index}.
@end defun

@defun chess-index-file index
Return the file component of the given @var{index}.
@end defun

@defun chess-rf-to-index rank file
Convert @var{rank} and @var{file} coordinates into an octal index.
@end defun

For those who wish to use @acronym{ASCII} coordinates, such as "e4", there
are two conversion functions:

@defun chess-coord-to-index coord
Convert a @var{coord} string into an index value.
@end defun

@defun chess-index-to-coord index
Convert the chess position @var{index} into a coord string.
@end defun

For fast manipulation of chess position indices, the following
constants and functions are provided:

@cindex queen
@cindex rook
For queens and rooks:

@cindex north
@defvr Constant chess-direction-north
Signify one step north, as seen from the perspective of the white player.
@end defvr

@cindex east
@defvr Constant chess-direction-east
Signify one step east, as seen from the perspective of the white player.
@end defvr

@cindex south
@defvr Constant chess-direction-south
Signify one step south, as seen from the perspective of the white player.
@end defvr

@cindex west
@defvr Constant chess-direction-west
Signify one step west, as seen from the perspective of the white player.
@end defvr

@cindex queen
@cindex bishop
For queens and bishops:

@cindex northeast
@defvr Constant chess-direction-northeast
Signify one step northeast, as seen from the perspective of the white player.
@end defvr

@cindex southeast
@defvr Constant chess-direction-southeast
Signify one step southeast, as seen from the perspective of the white player.
@end defvr

@cindex southwest
@defvr Constant chess-direction-southwest
Signify one step southwest, as seen from the perspective of the white player.
@end defvr

@cindex northwest
@defvr Constant chess-direction-northwest
Signify one step northwest, as seen from the perspective of the white player.
@end defvr

@defun chess-next-index index direction
Create a new @var{index} from an old one, by advancing it into @var{direction}.
If the resulting index is not valid (outside the board), nil is returned.
@end defun

Due to the underlying technique used to efficiently detect off-board squares,
a direction specifier should at most do two steps in any direction.
Directions can be combined, so that @code{(* chess-direction-north 2)}
will give a typical initial white pawn push.

@node Position details, Annotations, Position coordinates, Positions
@subsection Position details

With an octal index value, you can look up what's on a particular
square, or set that square's value:

@defun chess-pos-piece position index
Return the piece on @var{position} at @var{index}.
@end defun

@defun chess-pos-piece-p position index piece-or-color
Return non-nil if at @var{position}/@var{index} there is the given @var{piece-or-color}.
If @var{piece-or-color} is t for white or nil for black, any piece of that
color will do.
@end defun

@defun chess-pos-set-piece position index piece
Set the piece on @var{position} at @var{index} to @var{piece}.
@var{piece} must be one of @code{?K} @code{?Q} @code{?N} @code{?B}
@code{?R} or @code{?P}.  Use lowercase to set black pieces.
@end defun

@defun chess-pos-search position piece-or-color
Look on @var{position} anywhere for @var{piece-or-color}, returning all coordinates.
If @var{piece-or-color} is t for white or nil for black, any piece of that
color will do.
@end defun

@defun chess-pos-search* position &rest pieces
Look on @var{position} for any of @var{pieces}.

The result is an alist where each element looks like (@var{piece} . @var{indices}).
Pieces which did not appear in @var{position} will be present in the resulting
alist, but the `cdr' of their entries will be nil.
@end defun

@defun chess-search-position position target piece &optional check-only no-castling
Look on @var{position} from @var{target} for a @var{piece} that can move there.
This routine looks along legal paths of movement for @var{piece}.  It
differs from `chess-pos-search', which is a more basic function that
doesn't take piece movement into account.

If @var{piece} is t or nil, legal piece movements for any piece of that
color will be considered (t for white, nil for black).  Otherwise, the
case of the @var{piece} determines color.

The return value is a list of candidates, which means a list of
indices which indicate where a piece may have moved from.

If @var{check-only} is non-nil and @var{piece} is either t or nil, only consider
pieces which can give check (not the opponents king).
If @var{no-castling} is non-nil, do not consider castling moves.
@end defun

@c lispfun chess-pos-can-castle

@defun chess-pos-can-castle position side
Return whether the king on @var{position} can castle on @var{side}.
@var{side} must be either ?K for the king side, or ?Q for the queen side (use
lowercase to query if black can castle).
@end defun

@c lispfun chess-pos-set-can-castle

@defun chess-pos-set-can-castle position side value
Set whether the king can castle on the given @var{position} on @var{side}.

See `chess-pos-can-castle'.

It is only necessary to call this function if setting up a position
manually.  Note that all newly created positions have full castling
privileges set, unless the position is created blank, in which case
castling privileges are unset.  See `chess-pos-copy'.
@end defun

@c lispfun chess-pos-en-passant

@defun chess-pos-en-passant position
Return the index of any pawn on @var{position} that can be captured en passant.
Returns nil if en passant is unavailable.
@end defun

@c lispfun chess-pos-set-en-passant

@defun chess-pos-set-en-passant position index
Set the index of any pawn on @var{position} that can be captured en passant.
@end defun

@c lispfun chess-pos-status

@defun chess-pos-status position
Return whether the side to move in the @var{position} is in a special state.
nil is returned if not, otherwise one of the symbols: `check',
`checkmate', `stalemate'.
@end defun

@c lispfun chess-pos-set-status

@defun chess-pos-set-status position value
Set whether the side to move in @var{position} is in a special state.
@var{value} should either be nil, to indicate that the @var{position} is normal,
or one of the symbols: `check', `checkmate', `stalemate'.
@end defun

@c lispfun chess-pos-side-to-move

@defun chess-pos-side-to-move position
Return the color whose move it is in @var{position}.
@end defun

@c lispfun chess-pos-set-side-to-move

@defun chess-pos-set-side-to-move position color
Set the color whose move it is in @var{position}.
@end defun

@c lispfun chess-pos-passed-pawns

@defun chess-pos-passed-pawns position color &optional pawn-indices
If @var{color} has Passed Pawns in @var{position}, return a list of their indices.
Optionally, if @var{indices} is non-nil those indices are considered as candidates.

A Pawn whose advance to the eighth rank is not blocked by an
opposing Pawn in the same file and who does not have to pass one
on an adjoining file is called a passed Pawn.
@end defun

@defvar chess-pos-always-white
When set, it is assumed that white is always on move.
This is really only useful when setting up training positions.
This variable automatically becomes buffer-local when changed.
@end defvar

@c lispfun chess-pos-move

@defun chess-pos-move position &rest changes
Move a piece on the @var{position} directly, using the indices in @var{changes}.
This function does not check any rules, it only makes sure you are not
trying to move a blank square.
@end defun

@node Annotations, FEN notation, Position details, Positions
@subsection Annotations

@c lispfun chess-pos-annotations

@defun chess-pos-annotations position
Return the list of annotations for this position.
@end defun

@c lispfun chess-pos-add-annotation

@defun chess-pos-add-annotation position annotation
Add an annotation for this position.
@end defun

@node FEN notation, EPD notation, Annotations, Positions
@subsection FEN notation
@cindex fen

@dfn{@acronym{FEN, Forsyth-Edwards Notation}} encodes a chess position using
a simple string.  The format is:

   @var{position} @var{side} @var{castling} @var{en-passant}

The @var{position} gives all eight ranks, by specifying a letter for each
piece on the position, and a number for any intervening spaces, ranks
separated by slashes.
Trailing spaces need not be counted.  Uppercase letters signify
white, and lowercase black.  For example, if your position only had
a black king on d8, your @var{position} string would be:

@example
3k////////
@end example

For the three spaces (a, b and c file), the black king, and then
all the remaining ranks (which are all empty, so their spaces can
be ignored).

The @var{side} is @samp{w} or @samp{b}, to indicate whose move it is.

@var{castling} can contain @samp{K}, @samp{Q}, @samp{k} or @samp{q}, to signify
whether the white or black king can still castle on the king or queen side.
If neither colour can castle on any side, @samp{-} should be provided.

@var{en-passant} signifies the target square of an en passant capture, such as
@samp{e3} or @samp{a6}.

@defun chess-fen-to-pos fen
Convert a @var{fen}-like string to a chess position.
@end defun

@defun chess-pos-to-fen position &optional full
Convert a chess @var{position} to a @acronym{FEN} string.
If @var{full} is non-nil, represent trailing spaces as well.
@end defun

This is how the starting position looks like:

@vindex chess-starting-position
@lisp
(chess-pos-to-fen chess-starting-position)
@result{} "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/////PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -"
@end lisp

Some external programs might have problems parsing terse
FEN strings.  If you are unsure, use the more verbose form:

@lisp
(chess-pos-to-fen chess-starting-position t)
@result{} "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq -"
@end lisp

@node EPD notation,  , FEN notation, Positions
@subsection EPD notation

@dfn{@acronym{EPD, Extended Position Description}} is a standard for describing chess
positions along with an extended set of structured attribute values using the
@acronym{ASCII} character set.  It is intended for data and command interchange
among chess-playing programs.  It is also intended for the representation of
portable opening library repositories.

A single EPD uses one text line of variable length composed of four data field
followed by zero or more operations.  The four fields of the @acronym{EPD} specification
are the same as the first four fields of the @acronym{FEN} specification.

A text file composed exclusively of @acronym{EPD} data records should have a file name
with the suffix @file{.epd}.

@defun chess-epd-to-pos &optional string
Convert extended position description @var{string} to a chess position.
If @var{string} is not specified, look for an @acronym{epd} string in the current buffer,
and advance point after the correctly parsed position.
@end defun

@defun chess-pos-to-epd position
Convert a chess @var{position} to a string representation in extended
position description format.
@end defun

@defun chess-epd-read-file file

@node Operations, Opcode "acd" analysis count depth, EPD notation, EPD notation
@subsubsection Operations

An @acronym{EPD} operation is composed of an opcode followed by zero or
more operands and is concluded by a semicolon.

Multiple operations are separated by a single space character.  If there is at
least one operation present in an @acronym{EPD} record, it is separated from the last
(fourth) data field by a single space character.

Some opcodes that allow for more than one operand may have special ordering
requirements for the operands.  For example, the "pv" (predicted variation)
opcode requires its operands (moves) to appear in the order in which they would
be played.  All other opcodes that allow for more than one operand should have
operands appearing in @acronym{ASCII} order.  An example of the latter set is the "bm"
(best move[s]) opcode; its operands are moves that are all immediately playable
from the current position.

@node Opcode "acd" analysis count depth, Opcode "acn" analysis count nodes, Operations, EPD notation
@subsubsection Opcode "acd" analysis count depth

The opcode "acd" takes a single non-negative integer operand.  It is used to
represent the ply depth examined in an analysis.

@node Opcode "acn" analysis count nodes, Opcode "acs" analysis count seconds, Opcode "acd" analysis count depth, EPD notation
@subsubsection Opcode "acn" analysis count nodes

The opcode "acn" takes a single non-negative integer operand.  It is used to
represent the number of nodes examined in an analysis.  Note that the value may
be quite large for some extended searches and so use of (at least) a long (four
byte) representation is suggested.

@node Opcode "acs" analysis count seconds, Opcode "am" avoid move(s), Opcode "acn" analysis count nodes, EPD notation
@subsubsection Opcode "acs" analysis count seconds

The opcode "acs" takes a single non-negative integer operand.  It is used to
represent the number of seconds used for an analysis.  Note that the value may
be quite large for some extended searches and so use of (at least) a long (four
byte) representation is suggested.

@node Opcode "am" avoid move(s), Opcode "bm" best move(s), Opcode "acs" analysis count seconds, EPD notation
@subsubsection Opcode "am" avoid move(s)

The opcode "am" indicates a set of zero or more moves, all immediately playable
from the current position, that are to be avoided in the opinion of the EPD
writer.  Each operand is a @acronym{SAN} move; they appear in @acronym{ASCII} order.

@node Opcode "bm" best move(s),  , Opcode "am" avoid move(s), EPD notation
@subsubsection Opcode "bm" best move(s)

The opcode "bm" indicates a set of zero or more moves, all immediately playable
from the current position, that are judged to the best available by the EPD
writer.  Each operand is a @acronym{SAN} move; they appear in @acronym{ASCII} order.

@node Plies, Variations, Positions, The chess.el library
@section Plies

A @dfn{ply} is the differential between two positions.  Or, it is the
coordinate transformations applied to one position in order to arrive at
the following position.  It is also informally called "a move".

A ply may be represented in @acronym{ASCII} by printing the @acronym{FEN} string
of the base position, and then printing the positional transformation in algebraic
notation.  Since the starting position is usually known, the @acronym{FEN} string
is optional.  A ply may be represented graphically by moving the chess
piece(s) involved.  It may be rendered verbally by voicing which piece
is to move, where it will move to, and what will happen a result of the
move (piece capture, check, etc).

Plies may be sent over network connections, postal mail, e-mail, @abbr{etc.},
so long as the current position is maintained at both sides.
Transmitting the base position's @acronym{FEN} string along with the ply offers a
form of confirmation during the course of a game.

@defun chess-ply-final-p ply
Return non-nil if this is the last ply of a game/variation.
@end defun

@node Algebraic notation,  , The "next" position, Plies
@subsection Algebraic notation

A thing to deal with in chess is algebraic move notation, such as
@samp{Nxf3+}.  This notation is a shorthand way of representing where
a piece is moving from and to, by specifying the piece involved,
where it's going, and whether or not a capture or check is
involved.

You can convert from algebraic notation to a ply using the following function:

@defun chess-algebraic-to-ply position move &optional trust
Convert the algebraic notation @var{move} for @var{position} to a ply.
@end defun

The function also checks if a move is legal, and will raise an
error if not.

To convert from a ply to algebraic notation, use:

@defun chess-ply-to-algebraic ply &optional type
Convert the given @var{ply} to algebraic notation (a string).

Optional argument @var{type} specifies the kind of algebraic notation to
generate.
@code{:san} (the default) generates short (or standard) algebraic notation.
@code{:lan} generates long algebraic notation (like @samp{Nb1-c3}).
@code{:fan} generates figurine algebraic notation (uppercase letters will
be replaced by Unicode chess figures).
@end defun

Lastly, there is a regexp for quickly checking if a string is in
algebraic notation or not, or searching out algebraic strings in a
buffer:

@defvar chess-algebraic-regexp
A regular expression that matches all possible algebraic moves.
This regexp handles both long and short form.
@end defvar

@node Variations, Games, Plies, The chess.el library
@section Variations

A @dfn{variation} is a sequence of plies that occur after some starting
position.  If the starting position represents the initial setup of a
chess board, and if the final ply results in completion of the game, it
is called the "main variation".  Otherwise, variations typically
represented interesting tangents during a game---but not actually
played---as envisioned by the player, an annotator, or someone studying
the game.

Variations may be represented in @acronym{ASCII} by stating the @acronym{FEN}
string for starting position, followed by the list of plies that follow that
position.  They are difficult to represent graphically, except for
showing each position in turn with a slight pause between---or by
allowing the user to navigate each of the subsequent positions in turn.
They may be represented verbally by announcing each of the plies in
turn, as mentioned above.

@node Modules, Chessboard displays, The chess.el library, Top
@chapter Modules

Positions, plies and variations are typically accessed in reference to
a game object, which has a main variation containing the plies and
positions that represent the number of moves made within that game up
to the final position.

Another thing that the game object does is to manage events that occur
within that game.  If a move is made from the final position, for
example, it will cause a new ply to be created, adding it to the end
of the main variation.  Then, a `move' event is triggered within the
game and passed to any chess modules which are currently associated
with that game.  The concept of modules allows far more complex
aspects of chess playing to be dealt with, while allowing the library
itself to still operate solely in terms of the game object.

For example, although the plies of a game object contain all the
information the computer needs to follow the game, a user needs much
more.  He wants to see the pieces move.  To support this, a display
module (see next chapter) can be created, and linked to the game.  The
first effect of this association will be to create a chess board
display and show the game's final position on it.  Now whenever plies
are added to the game, the chess board will be updated to show the
effect of that move on the board.  The display module realizes that a
move has been made by receiving the `move' event which is passed to
all modules associated with the game object.

There may be any number of modules associated with a chess game, and
they may do anything you like.  Basically, for a module called
chess-sample, a function must exist called `chess-sample-handler'.
This takes two or more arguments: a game object, the event symbol, and
whatever other arguments were passed along with the event symbol.

When an event is triggered on a game object (and this may happen as a
byproduct of manipulating the game, or events may be manually
generated), every associated module, in order, is called with that
event and whatever arguments were passed along with the event.  The
game object is passed also, so that the module knows which game this
event has occurred in reference to.

Once called, the module can do whatever it likes.  Some events expect
certain values to be returned, to indicate success or failure in
processing the event.  There are many different events, each depicting
something specific that might happen in the context of playing or
manipulating a chess game.  Some events relate only to the chess game
itself, some are triggered by the various chess engines that might be
associated with that game.  Modules may even trigger events in
response to event.  The game itself remains unaware of events, except
for the fact that it will pass them along to every module associated
with that game.

This is how displays get updated, for example, because once a 'move'
event is triggered, each display knows that it must now look at the
new final position and update its display.  It may even trigger new
events special to displays, to cause a refresh to happen after update
calculations have been performed, for example.  All such details are
left to the module, and the game does not interfere with such
intra-module messaging.

Looked at as an object-oriented design, these are typical polymorphic
events.  Certain generic situations frequently occur, such as moves,
which trigger events so that everyone concerned with the game can be
updated as to the move that occurred.  This way, no one need to
actively query the game to find out if something new has happened.
The game will notify every listening module by sending an event.

The core library, which consists of code to manipulate games, does not
define any modules.  The rest of the chess.el library is strictly a
set of module implementations, of various types.  Display modules
react to moves, and may modify the game based on user input; engine
modules react to moves by notifying the engine of the move; network
client modules react to moves by sending the move text over the
network.  Engine and network modules may also trigger new events when
the engine or network player has decided on their move, and this move
is then applied to the game object.

At the moment, no negotiation is done to determine which module may
modify the game object.  All modules have equal privilege.  This means
it is the programmer's duty not to associate conflicting modules with
a single game object.  If two artificial intelligence engines were
linked, for example, they would quickly start stepping on each other's
toes.  But it perfectly fine to have one artificial intelligence
engine, and another passive engine whose only purpose is to relay the
moves to a networked observer on another computer.  The possibilities
are endless.

Modules are very easy to write, although engines and displays are
rather different from each other in their principles.  There is a base
engine, and a base display, which receive the same events as any other
module.  But then there are derived engines and derived displays which
trigger a whole family of events specific to those module types.  If
you suspect a bug in your module, put a breakpoint in your handler
function, and wait for the offending event to come through.  Then you
can watch what your module does in response to that event.  If it
leaves the game object alone, it should be easy to locate the problem,
since it will always be within the module itself.  But if your module
also modifies the game object in response to certain events, you may
induce a feedback loop that is much more difficult to sort out.  Test
often and keep in mind that *many* events might end up coming through
as a result of the game changes your module makes!

That, in essence, is how the module system works.  From the game
object's perspective, it is a very simple mechanism, much like a
function ring or a hook.  The hook is called at certain points, so
that any listener can react to changes in the game.  But from each
module's perspective, it is a rich way to allow inter-operation
between both passive and reactive modules, all of them acting together
to enrich the context of play involving the central game object.

The only other rule to be mentioned is that each module instance
should be associated with only one game object at a time, although a
game object may have unlimited modules of any type linked to it.
Otherwise, trying to update a chess board based on input from two
different games would get impossible to sort out.  Better to create a
new board for every game---the way ordinary humans would do it in the
real world.

A chess session assembles all modules mentioned in previous
chapters into a working system to interact with.  A session typically
consists of at least one display module, one engine module,
and possibly a number of optional modules.  All these mdoules
share a common game object which is used to keep track of the
currently active game.

@defun chess engine disable-popup engine-response-handler &rest engine-ctor-args
Play a game against @var{engine}.

This function constructs all the necessary modules required for a chess session.
In particular, it will start @var{engine} and create a chess display as
configured in @code{chess-default-display}.

This is the main entry-point for interactively launching
a chessboard display with associated engine.

If you want to launch a chess session as part of your own code,
the probably more expressive alias `chess-session' might be interesting
to use.

@section Chess ICS Mode
@cindex Chess ICS mode
@cindex mode, ICS

  The major mode for ICS buffers is Chess ICS mode.  Many of its special
commands are bound to the @kbd{C-c} prefix.  Here is a list of ICS mode
commands:

@table @kbd
@item @key{RET}
@kindex RET
@findex comint-send-input
Send the current line as input to the server
(@code{comint-send-input}).  Any prompt at the beginning of the
line is omitted.  If point is at the end of
buffer, this is like submitting the command line in an ordinary
interactive shell.  However, you can also invoke @key{RET} elsewhere
in the ICS buffer to submit the current line as input.

@item C-d
@kindex C-d
@findex comint-delchar-or-maybe-eof
Either delete a character or send @acronym{EOF, End Of File}
(@code{comint-delchar-or-maybe-eof}).  Typed at the end of the ICS
buffer, this sends @acronym{EOF} to the server and terminates the
connection.  Typed at any other
position in the buffer, this deletes a character as usual.

@item C-c C-a
@kindex C-c C-a
@findex comint-bol-or-process-mark
Move to the beginning of the line, but after the prompt if any
(@code{comint-bol-or-process-mark}).  If you repeat this command twice
in a row, the second time it moves back to the process mark, which is
the beginning of the input that you have not yet sent to the server.
(Normally that is the same place---the end of the prompt on this
line---but after @kbd{C-c @key{SPC}} the process mark may be in a
previous line.)

@item C-c @key{SPC}
@kindex C-c SPC
@findex comint-accumulate
Accumulate multiple lines of input, then send them together
(@code{comint-accumulate}).  This
command inserts a newline before point, but does not send the preceding
text as input to the server---at least, not yet.  Both lines, the one
before this newline and the one after, will be sent together (along with
the newline that separates them), when you type @key{RET}.

@item C-c C-u
@kindex C-c C-u
@findex comint-kill-input
Kill all text pending at end of buffer to be sent as input
(@code{comint-kill-input}).  If point is not at end of buffer,
this only kills the part of this text that precedes point.

@item C-c C-w
@kindex C-c C-w
@findex backward-kill-word
Kill a word before point (@code{backward-kill-word}).

@item C-c C-o
@kindex C-c C-o
@findex comint-delete-output
Delete the last batch of output from an ICS server command
(@code{comint-delete-output}).  This is useful if a server command spews
out lots of output that just gets in the way.

@item C-c C-s
@kindex C-c C-s
@findex comint-write-output
Write the last batch of output from an ICS server command to a file
(@code{comint-write-output}).  With a prefix argument, the file is
appended to instead.  Any prompt at the end of the output is not
written.

@item C-c C-r
@itemx C-M-l
@kindex C-c C-r
@kindex C-M-l
@findex comint-show-output
Scroll to display the beginning of the last batch of output at the top
of the window; also move the cursor there (@code{comint-show-output}).

@item C-c C-e
@kindex C-c C-e
@findex comint-show-maximum-output
Scroll to put the end of the buffer at the bottom of the window
(@code{comint-show-maximum-output}).

@item M-x comint-truncate-buffer
@findex comint-truncate-buffer
@vindex comint-buffer-maximum-size
This command truncates the ICS buffer to a certain maximum number of
lines, specified by the variable @code{comint-buffer-maximum-size}.
Here's how to do this automatically each time you get output from the
server:

@example
(add-hook 'comint-output-filter-functions
          'comint-truncate-buffer)
@end example
@end table

@cindex Comint mode
@cindex mode, Comint
  ICS mode is a derivative of Comint mode, a general-purpose mode for
communicating with interactive subprocesses.  Most of the features of
ICS mode actually come from Comint mode, as you can see from the
command names listed above.

@node Command History, Seeking an opponent for a new game, Chess ICS Mode, Internet Chess Servers
@section ICS Command History

  ICS buffers support two ways of repeating earlier commands.  You
can use keys like those used for the minibuffer history; these work
much as they do in the minibuffer, inserting text from prior commands
while point remains always at the end of the buffer.  You can move
through the buffer to previous inputs in their original place, then
resubmit them or copy them to the end.

@findex comint-dynamic-list-input-ring
Display the buffer's history of ICS commands in another window
(@code{comint-dynamic-list-input-ring}).
@end table

  ICS buffers provide a history of previously entered
commands.  To reuse commands from the history, use the editing
commands @kbd{M-p}, @kbd{M-n}, @kbd{M-r} and @kbd{M-s}.  These work
just like the minibuffer history commands (@pxref{Minibuffer
History, , , emacs}), except that they operate within the ICS buffer rather
than the minibuffer.

  @kbd{M-p} fetches an earlier ICS command to the end of the ICS
buffer.  Successive use of @kbd{M-p} fetches successively earlier
commands, each replacing any text that was already present as
potential input.  @kbd{M-n} does likewise except that it finds
successively more recent ICS commands from the buffer.
@kbd{C-@key{UP}} works like @kbd{M-p}, and @kbd{C-@key{DOWN}} like
@kbd{M-n}.

  The history search command @kbd{M-r} begins an incremental regular
expression search of previous ICS commands.  After typing @kbd{M-r},
start typing the desired string or regular expression; the last
matching ICS command will be displayed in the current line.
Incremental search commands have their usual effects---for instance,
@kbd{C-s} and @kbd{C-r} search forward and backward for the next match
(@pxref{Incremental Search, , , emacs}).  When you find the desired input, type
@key{RET} to terminate the search.  This puts the input in the command
line.  Any partial input you were composing before navigating the
history list is restored when you go to the beginning or end of the
history ring.

  Often it is useful to reexecute several successive ICS commands that
were previously executed in sequence.  To do this, first find and
reexecute the first command of the sequence.  Then type @kbd{C-c C-x};
that will fetch the following command---the one that follows the command
you just repeated.  Then type @key{RET} to reexecute this command.  You
can reexecute several successive commands by typing @kbd{C-c C-x
@key{RET}} over and over.

  The command @kbd{C-c .}@: (@code{comint-input-previous-argument})
copies an individual argument from a previous command, like
@kbd{@key{ESC} .} in Bash.  The simplest use copies the last argument from the
previous ICS command.  With a prefix argument @var{n}, it copies the
@var{n}th argument instead.  Repeating @kbd{C-c .} copies from an
earlier ICS command instead, always using the same value of @var{n}
(don't give a prefix argument when you repeat the @kbd{C-c .}
command).

  These commands get the text of previous ICS commands from a special
history list, not from the ICS buffer itself.  Thus, editing the ICS
buffer, or even killing large parts of it, does not affect the history
that these commands access.

@node ICS History Copying,  , ICS Command Ring, Command History
@subsection ICS History Copying

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c C-p
@findex comint-previous-prompt
@item C-c C-p
Move point to the previous prompt (@code{comint-previous-prompt}).

@kindex C-c C-n
@findex comint-next-prompt
@item C-c C-n
Move point to the following prompt (@code{comint-next-prompt}).

@kindex C-c RET
@findex comint-copy-old-input
@item C-c @key{RET}
Copy the input command at point, inserting the copy at the end of the
buffer (@code{comint-copy-old-input}).  This is useful if you move
point back to a previous command.  After you copy the command, you can
submit the copy as input with @key{RET}.  If you wish, you can edit
the copy before resubmitting it.  If you use this command on an output
line, it copies that line to the end of the buffer.

@item Mouse-2
If @code{comint-use-prompt-regexp} is @code{nil} (the default), copy
the old input command that you click on, inserting the copy at the end
of the buffer (@code{comint-insert-input}).  If
@code{comint-use-prompt-regexp} is non-@code{nil}, or if the click is
not over old input, just yank as usual.
@end table

  Moving to a previous input and then copying it with @kbd{C-c
@key{RET}} or @kbd{Mouse-2} produces the same results---the same
buffer contents---that you would get by using @kbd{M-p} enough times
to fetch that previous input from the history list.  However, @kbd{C-c
@key{RET}} copies the text from the buffer, which can be different
from what is in the history list if you edit the input text in the
buffer after it has been sent.

After you connected to a server, one of the first things you will
want to do is find an oponent for a new game.  You can use the
ICS command "seek" to announce your availability for a chess game

You can also watch other games currently being played on @acronym{ICS}.
Even services like @samp{LectureBot} from @acronym{FICS} can
be used.

@example
fics% observe lecturebot
You are now observing game 5.
Game 5: LectureBot (0) LectureBot (0) unrated untimed 0 0

LectureBot(TD)(----)[5] kibitzes: (Note: A passed pawn is a pawn that
          does not have enemy pawns blocking the path either on the
          same or adjacent files).
LectureBot(TD)(----)[5] kibitzes: Connected passed pawns are a pain to
          have to deal with. They are usually a winning advantage if
          they cannot be blockaded. The blockading piece has to give
          up duties elsewhere. It's almost like being a piece up.
fics% unobserv lecturebot
Removing game 5 from observation list.

@end example

Once you start to observe a particular game or player, the
current position will pop up in a chessboard display.
As you are an observer, you will not be able to enter new moves.
However, you should be able to navigate back and forth in the history
of the game.

If a new move is made by any party in the game and you are currently
displaying the last position in the game, the chessboard display
will automaticall update to reflect the new position and show
the last move in the mode line.
